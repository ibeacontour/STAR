As of right now the software is fairly simple to use. Starting it like a typical java project (which may very depending on the IDE you use if any) will yeild you with an icon in your system tray. The tray icon itself can be clicked and will display a menu where you can see info about the program or exit. As long as the program is running, Ctrl+Space can be used as hotkeys to bring up a windows containing a search box which will allow you to type in a query. Hitting enter after typing a query will cause the program to search your computer for files containing this name in it. Upon completing this search the program will list these results. Double clicking executable files will cause them to run.
