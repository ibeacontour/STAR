Useful commands and what they mean for git with esclipse

Right click any part of area under 'project explorer'
  under 'Team' (6th from the bottom of the list I believe)

commit: saves your changes to your local copy
merge: merges your local copy with the copy on Git (updates the master on Git with yours)
Push branch: pushes your copy as a seperate branch on Git (seperate from the master)
Pull: pretty much updates your local copy with that of the master branch

these should be the only commands under that, that we should be using.
