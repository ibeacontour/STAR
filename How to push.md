How to merge:

there is a nice video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK20jVt7XEc

1) commit your local changes
2) pull
3) use the merge tool (same place as the commit and pull actions are located)
4) there will be two windows. your local copy will be on the left and the master copy on the right
    resolve these conflicts (surrounded by red boxes), usually by copy/pasting
5) commit again and select 'commit and push'
